Can I clearly track the development of my website through my commits?
Yes because I can look at my commits and see the previous changes I made in my code.
How effectively do the commit messages communicate what I was doing?
Very effectively because it shows you the changes you made.
How might I embed this process, or something similar in other places of my life?
Saving progress is very important and can be used in other situations where seeing the process is important.
