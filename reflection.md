What was challenging for you during this process?
Trying to code something that looked like an identifiable object while meeting the requirements.
What makes more sense now than it did before you started?
How to create and place shapes around the canvas.
What are you proud of?
Im proud of the sketch that I made because it ended up looking like how I wanted it to.

I incorporated my original plan as inspiration but my final sketch was more complex.
